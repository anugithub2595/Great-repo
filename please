I'm currently into sports betting but the process of finding data, aggregating it, creating visualizations and analyzing it is very cumbersome and time consumung. Not to also talk about finding live or recent news updates about the sports events to take place.
I'm currently only focused on association football (soccer) and tennis [option available to expand into other sports soon].

In the same fashion of a stock/forex trading dashboard, i want to develop a pesonalized, sports analytics and betting dashboard that integrations soccer and tennis API data.

the platform/dashboard can have the following features/integrations.
1. Head to Head Team/player comparison tool
2. twitter integration for live updates
3. google search updates/rss feed/news feed integration for the latest new updates.
4. data visualization integrations
5. data tabulation tool
6. graphing tool/interface to track trends

football api can be acquired from say : https://apifootball.com/

tennis api can be acquired from say: https://betsapi.com/c/Tennis

the apis are options but we can finalize on the best one.

The key is to build an all-one dashboard that integrates news feed, historical and live statistical data into the dashboard so i'm able to;
1. have all the days matches preselected in real time.
2. with some search filters, i can decide which matches i want to bet on for the day.
3. have all the data in one dashboard so i dont have go searching on google or other websites
4. save me hours daily on my betting analysis.

Should this project be successful, i'm looking to provide a month-to-month, indefinite maintenance contract to the successful developer/team (with additional monthly pay).

Looking to hire immediately.
