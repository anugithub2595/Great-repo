The objective if the job is to propose an architectural design on the best way to build an islamic microfinance core banking system on top of Apache Fineract and Mifos X.
The proposed architecture should let me continue benefiting from Fineract updates seamesly while developing specific features.
The candidate should have a deep knowledge of the Fineracr architecture and the diffrent ways it offer to build solutions upon it.
The deliverable will be a document that explain the proposed architecture design plus new classes and methods that illustrate this architecture.
I will give high level functionnal specifications later.The objective if the job is to propose an architectural design on the best way to build an islamic microfinance core banking system on top of Apache Fineract and Mifos X.
