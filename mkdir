 have list of websites. These websites are hosted online and made by any kind of CMS or programming language. I do not have any source code of these websites, I only have the URL.
I need someone to develop a software that copies these websites somehow so that the websites are fully functional on another host. This host has only one URL address, but the websites need to be accessible there in some sort of sub folders.
The websites are rather simple one-page websites.I have list of websites. These websites are hosted online and made by any kind of CMS or programming language. I do not have any source code of these websites, I only have the URL.
